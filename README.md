I come from a creative storytelling background, and I’m transforming that skill into building meaningful user experiences in technology. 

Over the years, I’ve created content on YouTube and podcasts where I’ve developed a strong ability to communicate complex technical concepts in a way that is simple and engaging for different audiences. 
That strength naturally evolved into defining clear user stories and mapping intuitive user journeys during product ideation.

On the technical side, I’ve built projects ranging from a speech-to-text mental health journaling app to penetration testing scripts for reconnaissance, as well as full-stack projects like an Airbnb clone using Python, MySQL, and Linux-based infrastructure. 

These experiences have strengthened my problem-solving abilities and helped me adapt quickly in fast-paced environments.

What makes me unique is the intersection I operate in — I can think like a storyteller, execute like an engineer, and communicate like a teacher. I’m passionate about creating solutions that are not just functional, but understandable and impactful to both users and business stakeholders. 

I’m now looking for opportunities where I can contribute that blend of creativity, technical execution, and clarity in communication to help teams build products that truly matter.
